# CBDO Core Engine

> 🚧 Reference implementation of the CBDO Core Engine (spec v0.1) — not production-ready

**Consent-Based Data Object Core Engine** — the active execution layer that transforms W3C Verifiable Credentials into policy-enforced, query-responsive verification systems.

> *Verifiers ask questions. The engine answers them. Credential data never leaves.*

## What This Is

The Core Engine is the middleware between a user's verifiable credential and any external party that wants to ask a question about it.

Instead of exposing a credential field (e.g. date of birth), a verifier submits a structured query (e.g. "is this person over 18?"). The engine evaluates it internally and returns only a minimized, cryptographically provable answer: `true` or `false` + a proof.

The date of birth never appears in any response. Ever.

---

## Why This Exists

Current verification systems require exposing raw data to prove simple claims — creating unnecessary privacy risk, storage liability, and regulatory burden.

The CBDO Core Engine demonstrates an alternative model:

- Verifiers receive only the answer they need (e.g. `true/false`)
- Raw credential data never leaves the user's control
- Every interaction is enforced by policy, consent, and cryptographic proof

This repository provides a working reference implementation of that model.

## Quick Start

```bash
node demo/agepass-demo.js
```

No dependencies required for the demo — the stub proof generator uses Node's built-in `crypto` module.

## Architecture

```
CoreEngine (orchestrator)
├── ProfileLoader     — loads and validates profile schemas
├── QueryValidator    — validates queries before any data access  
├── ConsentEngine     — state machine: UNKNOWN→PENDING→GRANTED/DENIED
├── ResponseMinimizer — strips responses to permitted fields only
├── ProofGenerator    — ⚠ STUB: replace with BBS+/ZKP library
└── AuditLogger       — append-only cryptographically chained log
```

## Processing Pipeline

Every query follows this exact sequence (never skipped or reordered):

1. Receive query
2. Load profile
3. Validate query against profile schema
4. Evaluate consent state
5. Execute query against credential data **internally**
6. Minimize response to permitted fields only
7. Generate cryptographic proof
8. Log to audit trail
9. Return minimized response + proof

Credential data is accessed **only in step 5**. It never appears in output.

## Profiles

A profile defines what questions can be asked about a CBDO and how answers must be returned. Currently included:

| Profile | File | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| AgePass v1 | `src/profiles/agepass-v1.json` | ✓ Complete |
| CareerPass v1 | — | Planned |
| MedPass v1 | — | Planned |

## Production Readiness

This is a **reference implementation**. The following components require replacement before production deployment:

### ⚠ ProofGenerator (Critical)

`src/engine/ProofGenerator.js` contains a stub that produces non-cryptographic proofs. Replace with:

- **BBS+ selective disclosure**: `@mattrglobal/bbs-signatures` or W3C Data Integrity BBS cryptosuite
- **ZKP range proofs**: `noble-curves` (Bulletproofs) or `snarkjs` (Groth16)

The choice of ZKP scheme requires cryptographic expert review. Do not self-select.

### ⚠ QueryValidator Signature Verification

`src/engine/QueryValidator.js` stubs verifier signature verification. Production requires:
- DID resolution via `did-resolver`
- Verification method extraction from DID documents  
- Signature verification over canonical query body

### ⚠ Nonce Store

Current nonce store is in-memory. Production requires:
- Persistent backing store (Redis recommended)
- TTL-based expiry aligned with 24-hour window
